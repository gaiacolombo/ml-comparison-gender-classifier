# Classification with Machine Learning Models and analysis of results

This project aims to compare machine learning models in the classification of subjects based on facial attributes into males and females. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elakiricoder/gender-classification-dataset).

## Project Overview

The project includes the following key steps:

1. **Covariate Analysis**:
   - Univariate Analysis
   - Multivariate Analysis
2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Baseline Model
   - Decision Trees
   - Neural Network
   - Naive Bayes
3. **Model Comparison**:
   - ROC Curves
   - Performance Measures
   - Maximum Accuracy
   - Training Times

## Conclusions

The project identifies the model that best integrates efficiency and efficacy for gender classification based on facial attributes.
